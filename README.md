# CyberGraph_Nextjs
 Build an interactive, front-end visualization using NextJS that represents the flow and connections in a cybersecurity attack graph. This graph should be dynamically generated based on backend-provided data, showing each cybersecurity entity as nodes and the information they derived as edges to other information nodes. When clicked, each node or edge should display additional information (such as outputs, related tools, and agent-specific details), allowing users to explore complex relationships and processes visually. The interactive visualization should be responsive, intuitive, and provide real-time updates when new data arrives.
